# Continuous Memory for Claude Code

Claude Code starts every session blank. It doesn't know what you worked on yesterday, what conventions your team follows, or what mistakes it already made. You re-explain everything, every time.

Claude Remember fixes that. It hooks into Claude Code's lifecycle — saving sessions automatically, compressing them through Haiku into layered daily summaries, and loading them back into context on the next session start. No manual prompting, no copy-pasting notes. The agent starts every session with its history already present.

The result: your Claude Code instance develops continuity. It remembers what it learned, what broke, what worked. Not perfect recall — compressed, practical memory that fits in minimal tokens.

## How it works

```
tool use → save-session.sh → extract (Python) → summarize (Haiku) → now.md
                                                                       ↓
                                                            hourly NDC compression
                                                                       ↓
                                                              today-YYYY-MM-DD.md
                                                                       ↓
                                                            daily consolidation
                                                                       ↓
                                                              recent.md + archive.md
```

Each layer compresses the one above it. Raw exchanges become one-line summaries. Daily summaries become weekly paragraphs. The result: full context in minimal tokens.

On session start, the `SessionStart` hook automatically injects into Claude's context:
- `identity.md` — who the agent is
- `remember.md` — the handoff note from the last session
- `now.md` — current session buffer
- `today-*.md` — today's compressed history
- `recent.md` — last 7 days
- `archive.md` — older history

No manual prompting, no "read this file" instructions. The agent begins every session with its memory already loaded. It just remembers.

## Cost

The pipeline uses Claude Haiku for summarization and compression. Haiku is the smallest, cheapest Claude model. A typical session save costs **< $0.01** — a few thousand input tokens (the session exchanges) and a few hundred output tokens (the summary). Daily compression and consolidation add a few more Haiku calls.

In practice, running this all day costs **a few cents per day**. The Anthropic API key used by the Claude CLI is the same one that powers the calls — no separate billing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Claude CLI (`claude`) with Haiku access
- Bash 4+

## Setup

1. Copy `.claude/remember/` into your project's `.claude/` directory
2. Add the hooks to your `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/remember/scripts/session-start-hook.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/remember/scripts/user-prompt-hook.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/remember/scripts/post-tool-hook.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Write your agent's identity in `.claude/remember/identity.md` (see `identity.example.md`)
4. Set **Auto-compact** to `false` in Claude Code preferences (`/config`) — auto-compact discards conversation history before the save pipeline can capture it. [Why this matters](https://max.dp.tools/posts/12-context-is-a-trap.php)
5. Enable the **status line** in Claude Code (`/statusline`) to see your current context usage — when context gets high, it's time to save and start a new session

## Hooks

The plugin registers three Claude Code hooks:

| Hook               | Script                  | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SessionStart`     | `session-start-hook.sh` | Loads memory files into context, recovers missed sessions |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `user-prompt-hook.sh`   | Injects current timestamp so the agent knows the time     |
| `PostToolUse`      | `post-tool-hook.sh`     | Auto-saves session when tool call delta exceeds threshold |

Each hook sources `log.sh` for shared config, timezone, logging, and the `dispatch()` system. Hooks dispatch lifecycle events (e.g., `after_user_prompt`) to extensible listeners in `hooks.d/`.

## Handoff between sessions (`/remember`)

Before clearing context or ending a session, type `/remember`. The agent writes a short handoff note to `.remember/remember.md` — what's done, what's next, any non-obvious context. The next session reads it and picks up where you left off. This is complementary to the automatic pipeline: the pipeline captures what happened, the handoff captures what matters next.

## Data files

The pipeline writes to `.remember/` (created automatically, self-gitignored):

| File                           | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.remember/now.md`             | Current session buffer                            |
| `.remember/today-*.md`         | Daily compressed summaries                        |
| `.remember/recent.md`          | Last 7 days consolidated                          |
| `.remember/archive.md`         | Older history consolidated                        |
| `.remember/logs/`              | Pipeline logs                                     |
| `.remember/tmp/`               | Lock files, cooldown markers                      |
| `.claude/remember/identity.md` | Your agent's identity and values (you write this) |

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and adjust:

| Key                              | Default | Purpose                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `data_dir`                       | `.remember` | Where output files are written                 |
| `cooldowns.save_seconds`         | `120`   | Minimum seconds between saves                      |
| `cooldowns.ndc_seconds`          | `3600`  | Compression interval (hourly)                      |
| `thresholds.min_human_messages`  | `3`     | Minimum messages before saving                     |
| `thresholds.delta_lines_trigger` | `50`    | Tool call output lines that trigger auto-save      |
| `features.ndc_compression`      | `true`  | Enable hourly compression of daily files           |
| `features.recovery`             | `true`  | Recover missed saves on session start              |
| `timezone`                       | `UTC`   | Timezone for timestamps and daily file boundaries  |
| `debug`                          | `false` | Verbose logging for cooldowns and locks            |
