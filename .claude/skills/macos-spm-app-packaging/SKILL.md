# macOS SwiftPM App Packaging (No Xcode)

## 概述
Bootstrap a complete SwiftPM macOS app folder, then build, package, and run it without Xcode. Use `assets/templates/bootstrap/` for the starter layout and `references/packaging.md` + `references/release.md` for packaging and release details.

## When to Use
- When the user needs a SwiftPM-based macOS app without relying on an Xcode project.
- When you need packaging, signing, notarization, or appcast guidance for a SwiftPM app.

## Two-Step Workflow
1) Bootstrap the project folder
   - Copy `assets/templates/bootstrap/` into a new repo.
   - Rename `MyApp` in `Package.swift`, `Sources/MyApp/`, and `version.env`.
   - Customize `APP_NAME`, `BUNDLE_ID`, and versions.

2) Build, package, and run the bootstrapped app
   - Copy scripts from `assets/templates/` into your repo (for example, `Scripts/`).
   - Build/tests: `swift build` and `swift test`.
   - Package: `Scripts/package_app.sh`.
   - Run: `Scripts/compile_and_run.sh` (preferred) or `Scripts/launch.sh`.
   - Release (optional): `Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh` and `Scripts/make_appcast.sh`.
   - Tag + GitHub release (optional): create a git tag, upload the zip/appcast to the GitHub release, and publish.

## Minimum End-to-End 示例
Shortest path from bootstrap to a running app:
```bash
# 1. Copy and rename the skeleton
cp -R assets/templates/bootstrap/ ~/Projects/MyApp
cd ~/Projects/MyApp
sed -i '' 's/MyApp/HelloApp/g' Package.swift version.env

# 2. Copy scripts
cp assets/templates/package_app.sh Scripts/
cp assets/templates/compile_and_run.sh Scripts/
chmod +x Scripts/*.sh

# 3. Build and launch
swift build
Scripts/compile_and_run.sh
```

## Validation Checkpoints
Run these after key steps to catch failures early before proceeding to the next stage.

**After packaging (`Scripts/package_app.sh`):**
```bash
# Confirm .app bundle structure is intact
ls -R build/HelloApp.app/Contents

# Check that the binary is present and executable
file build/HelloApp.app/Contents/MacOS/HelloApp
```

**After signing (`Scripts/sign-and-notarize.sh` or ad-hoc dev signing):**
```bash
# Inspect signature and entitlements
codesign -dv --verbose=4 build/HelloApp.app

# Verify the bundle passes Gatekeeper checks locally
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose build/HelloApp.app
```

**After notarization and stapling:**
```bash
# Confirm the staple ticket is attached
stapler validate build/HelloApp.app

# Re-run Gatekeeper to confirm notarization is recognised
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose build/HelloApp.app
```
