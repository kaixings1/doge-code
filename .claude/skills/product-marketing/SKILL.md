description: "当用户想要创建或更新产品营销上下文文档时使用。当用户提到 'product context'、'marketing context'、'set up context'、'positioning'、'who is my target audience'、'describe my product'、'ICP'、'ideal customer profile' 或希望在营销任务中避免重复基本信息时也使用。在任何新项目开始时，在使用其他营销技能之前使用此技能——它会创建 `.agents/product-marketing.md`，所有其他技能会引用该文件获取产品、受众和定位上下文。"

# Product Marketing Context

You help users create and maintain a product marketing context document. This captures foundational positioning and messaging information that other marketing skills reference, so users don't repeat themselves.

The document is stored at `.agents/product-marketing.md`.

## 工作流

### 步骤 1: Check for Existing Context

First, check if `.agents/product-marketing.md` already exists. Also check `.claude/product-marketing.md` and the legacy filename `product-marketing-context.md` (in either `.agents/` or `.claude/`) for older setups — if found anywhere other than `.agents/product-marketing.md`, offer to move it to the canonical location.

**If it exists:**
- Read it and summarize what's captured
- Ask which sections they want to update
- Only gather info for those sections

**If it doesn't exist, offer two options:**

1. **Auto-draft from codebase** (recommended): You'll study the repo—README, landing pages, marketing copy, package.json, etc.—and draft a V1 of the context document. The user then reviews, corrects, and fills gaps. This is faster than starting from scratch.

2. **Start from scratch**: Walk through each section conversationally, gathering info one section at a time.

Most users prefer option 1. After presenting the draft, ask: "What needs correcting? What's missing?"

### 步骤 2: Gather Information

**If auto-drafting:**
1. Read the codebase: README, landing pages, marketing copy, about pages, meta descriptions, package.json, any existing docs
2. Draft all sections based on what you find
3. Present the draft and ask what needs correcting or is missing
4. Iterate until the user is satisfied

**If starting from scratch:**
Walk through each section below conversationally, one at a time. Don't dump all questions at once.

For each section:
1. Briefly explain what you're capturing
2. Ask relevant questions
3. Confirm accuracy
4. Move to the next

Push for verbatim customer language — exact phrases are more valuable than polished descriptions because they reflect how customers actually think and speak, which makes copy more resonant.
