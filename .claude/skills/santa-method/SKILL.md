# Santa Method

Multi-agent adversarial verification framework. Make a list, check it twice. If it's naughty, fix it until it's nice.

The core insight: a single agent reviewing its own output shares the same biases, knowledge gaps, and systematic errors that produced the output. Two independent reviewers with no shared context break this failure mode.

## When to Activate

Invoke this skill when:
- Output will be published, deployed, or consumed by end users
- Compliance, regulatory, or brand constraints must be enforced
- Code ships to production without human review
- Content accuracy matters (technical docs, educational material, customer-facing copy)
- Batch generation at scale where spot-checking misses systemic patterns
- Hallucination risk is elevated (claims, statistics, API references, legal language)

Do NOT use for internal drafts, exploratory research, or tasks with deterministic verification (use build/test/lint pipelines for those).

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Make a List (Generate)

Execute the primary task. No changes to your normal generation workflow. Santa Method is a post-generation verification layer, not a generation strategy.

```python
# The generator runs as normal
output = generate(task_spec)
```

### Phase 2: Check It Twice (Independent Dual Review)

Spawn two review agents in parallel. Critical invariants:

1. **Context isolation** — neither reviewer sees the other's assessment
2. **Identical rubric** — both receive the same evaluation criteria
3. **Same inputs** — both receive the original spec AND the generated output
4. **Structured output** — each returns a typed verdict, not prose

```python
REVIEWER_PROMPT = """
You are an independent quality reviewer. You have NOT seen any other review of this output.

## Task Specification
{task_spec}

## Output Under Review
{output}

## Evaluation Rubric
{rubric}

## Instructions
Evaluate the output against EACH rubric criterion. For each:
- PASS: criterion fully met, no issues
- FAIL: specific issue found (cite the exact problem)

Return your assessment as structured JSON:
{
  "verdict": "PASS" | "FAIL",
  "checks": [
    {"criterion": "...", "result": "PASS|FAIL", "detail": "..."}
  ],
  "critical_issues": ["..."],   // blockers that must be fixed
  "suggestions": ["..."]         // non-blocking improvements
}

Be rigorous. Your job is to find problems, not to approve.
"""
```

```python
# Spawn reviewers in parallel (Claude Code subagents)
review_b = Agent(prompt=REVIEWER_PROMPT.format(...), description="Santa Reviewer B")
review_c = Agent(prompt=REVIEWER_PROMPT.format(...), description="Santa Reviewer C")

# Both run concurrently — neither sees the other
```

### Rubric Design

The rubric is the most important input. Vague rubrics produce vague reviews. Every criterion must have an objective pass/fail condition.
